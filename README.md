# Flat-Icon-Generator (FIG)

##What
Creates an Android-style flat icon from a given image file. Works with most common image formats, though optimized for high-quality PNGs.
###Examples:
![Flash Icon](examples/flash.png?raw=true "Flash Icon")
![Apple Icon](examples/apple.png?raw=true "Apple Icon")
![Twitter Icon](examples/twitter.png?raw=true "Twitter Icon")
![Laptop Icon](examples/laptop.png?raw=true "Laptop Icon")

##How
FIG uses HTML5 Canvas to draw a shadow of a given opacity at a given angle from the source icon. You can also set a background of any color in a square or circular shape.
